      <p>Here is a picture of me drinking tea while visiting a friend in London. I'm a middler at Northeastern studying the combined Marketing and Interactive Media track. One reason I have for taking this class is that its required for my major. However, this already seems like a really cool and valuable skill to have. Being a Marketing and Interactive Media major, I have a large interest in design concepts as well as business and now that everything seems to be technology-based I would really love to be able to create/understand a little bit of coding.</p>

      <p>I'm also a huge fan of the movie <font style='font-style:italic; color:gray;'>Jaws</font> (if you couldn't tell from the photos I snuck onto my Home page). Me and my close knit family and family friends from home grew up on the strange tradition of watching the movie every 3rd of July and on Christmas Eve! It might technically be a scary movie but it loses the scare factor after seeing it a couple hundred times so we all watch it together as if it's a family movie every year. The bridge in the above picture has become famous for its part in the movie and we make the trip to jump off of it each year.</p>

      <p>One of my absolute favorite things to do is ski. My parents had me on skis by the time I was 5 years old and I've been loving it ever since. I somehow still haven't gotten a chance to go this year but I'm planning on it! The picture above is at Loon Mountain in New Hampshire.</p>

      <p>Here is a photo of my dog Hunter. I just adopted him over the summer and he's already 3x the size he was when we got him. He's a German Shepard/Black Lab mix and wicked cute.</p>
